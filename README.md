A   15,000-word traditional dissertation with the following, suggested   structure:
Title   page – With title and any subtitle   of the   dissertation,   author’s   name,student   number   and title   of   degree.
Acknowledgements –   Brief thankyou section to those who   have   helped you along the   way.
Contents   page –   Full   list of contents –   usually chapter   headings and   subsection   headings. Also   includes   separate   lists of figures and   tables.
Abstract –An abstract should describe the whole of   the   dissertation:   its   approach,   the   main   literature         and theory   used, the   methods,   important   discussions/debates and the   main   results and conclusions.   It   should   be written   in   PAST tense.   No   more than   a   page.Introduction – A   brief   introduction to the dissertation subject area   highlighting   key   issues   or   reasons   for   the study and,   perhaps, any   important areas or   approaches   not   included   in   the   research.   Contemporary   data and scene setting. This chapter   should   end   with the   overall   aim   of the   research,   clear   statement   of   research question(s) and   list of objectives   [primary   and secondary].
Literature   Review – A thorough, analytical   and   reflective analysis of the   relevant   literature. Typically,   this   starts with   literature that sets the context for the   study   and   explains terms   and theoretical   frameworks            or concepts which are of   interest. Several   areas   of   interest   maybe   explored   and   their   significance to   the      topic should   be   made clear   by the   author.
Methodology –Some assessment of the   possible   methods as well   as   an   account   and justification   of the   method(s) chosen. This section will   usually   include an   account   of   how the   data   will   be   gathered including any   potential   problems or   issues.   Headings should   include: justification of the   chosen paradigm   [relating to the overall aim of the   study];   primary   and   secondary data   collection;   sampling;   recruitment of   respondents;   research design and   procedures;   limitations of   the   research;   validity, objectivity and   reliability of the   research design.
Findings/Results – The data generated   by the above,   including any   problems   arising   during   data   collection.   It should   be   reported as completely and   neutrally   as   possible   so   that   the   reader   can   assess   it.   In   many cases some analysis will   have   been carried   out   and   this   should   be   made   clear.
Analysis/Discussion – The   main analysis should   be separated out.   Further   discussion   of   the   data   and analysis   may   be another separate section depending   on the   nature   of   the   study.   The   analysis   MUST   benchmark the   primary   research findings with the   review of the   literature – so   that   the   student   shows   they   have   reflected   upon and thought about the   impact   of their   study   on   current   understanding.
Conclusions and   Recommendations – Conclusions should coverall the   implications   of the   study,   including those from   literature, from a consideration   of   methods, from   data   collection   and   data   analysis.   A clear summary and   insight, an   overall   conclusion   to the   research   aim   and   objectives   must   be   given   herewith some assessment of the strength   of   conclusions.   Recommendations   can   be   made   concerning all aspects of the   research and for future   research,   especially   for   the   industry   used   for   the   context   of   the   study.
Appendices,   Illustrations, etc. – Any   necessary additional   information should   be   placed   here, for   example, sample questionnaires, topic guides, transcriptions, etc.
References –   Full   references to every source   used,   including   in-text citations,   must   be   presented
following the   Harvard System of   referencing.   Bibliography   [sources   read   but   not   cited]   may also   be   included   but   is   not   mandatory.
